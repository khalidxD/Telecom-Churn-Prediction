# Telecom-Churn-Prediction. 
Telecom Churn Prediction is a project focused on developing a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn or switch to a different telecom service provider. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their current service and move on to a competitor's offering.  

In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to a telecom dataset to analyze various customer attributes and behavior patterns to predict churn. The goal was to help the telecom company understand factors that contribute to customer churn and take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.  

Key steps involved in the Telecom Churn Prediction project include:

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: I performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset, identify missing values, handle categorical variables, and preprocess the data for model building.

2. Feature Engineering: I derived new features from existing ones, such as calculating usage metrics or creating customer segments based on usage patterns. This step aimed to provide additional information to improve the model's predictive power.  

3. Model Selection and Evaluation: I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost. I used techniques like cross-validation and grid search to tune the model parameters and evaluated the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

4. Handling Class Imbalance: Churn prediction datasets often have imbalanced classes, with a small percentage of churned customers compared to non-churned ones. I addressed this issue by applying techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes and improve the model's performance.  

5. Model Deployment and Interpretation: Once the best-performing model was identified, I deployed it to make churn predictions on new data. I interpreted the model results to gain insights into the factors driving customer churn and provided recommendations to the telecom company for customer retention strategies.  

6. Reporting and Visualization: I generated visualizations and reports to communicate the findings effectively, including churn analysis, feature importance, and model performance metrics.
